Customizable switch view.
Interface is close to UISwitch.
Don't forget to add QuartzCore framework to your project.
Proper usage require [[DXSwitch] alloc] initWithOnBackgroundName:...].
You would like to add pictures [setOnImage:offImage:] or text [setLabelsWithFont:onText:offText:] right after the switch initialization.
